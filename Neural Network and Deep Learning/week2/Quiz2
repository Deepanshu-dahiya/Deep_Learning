Question 1
What does a neuron compute?
Answer    A neuron computes a linear function (z = Wx + b) followed by an activation function
2.
Question 2
Which of these is the "Logistic Loss"?
Answer      {L}^{(i)}(\hat{y}^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) = -( y^{(i)}\log(\hat{y}^{(i)}) + (1- y^{(i)})\log(1-\hat{y}^{(i)})

Question 3
Suppose img is a (32,32,3) array, representing a 32x32 image with 3 color channels red, green and blue. How do you reshape this into a column vector?
Answer      x = img.reshape((32*32*3,1))

Question 4
Consider the two following random arrays "a" and "b":
Answer    c.shape = (2, 3)

5.
Question 5
Consider the two following random arrays "a" and "b":
Answer    The computation cannot happen because the sizes don't match. It's going to be "Error"!

6.
Question 6
Suppose you have n_xn  x input features per example. Recall that X = [x^{(1)} x^{(2)} ... x^{(m)}]X=[x (1)x (2)...x (m)]. What is the dimension of X?
Answer    (nx,m)

Question 7
Recall that "np.dot(a,b)" performs a matrix multiplication on a and b, whereas "a*b" performs an element-wise multiplication.

Consider the two following random arrays "a" and "b":


What is the shape of c?
Answer    c.shape = (12288, 45)



8.
Question 8
Consider the following code snippet:


How do you vectorize this?

Answer    c = a + b.T



9.
Question 9
Consider the following code:


What will be c? (If you’re not sure, feel free to run this in python to find out).
Answer      This will invoke broadcasting, so b is copied three times to become (3,3), and *∗ is an element-wise product so c.shape will be (3, 3)


10.
Question 10
Consider the following computation graph.


What is the output J?

Answer    J = (a - 1) * (b + c)
